I. SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

You will find the following software packages:

- torc_lite: a tasking library that allows us to write platform-independent code
- pndl: parallel numerical differentiation library, built on top of torc_lite
- engines: the UQ framework built on top of torc_lite. 


II. PREREQUISITES
- An MPI implementation must be installed on your system (preferably with full thread safety)
- GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is required by some engines and must be installed on your system


III. INSTALLATION STEPS

1) First we start with torc_lite. We assume that the MPI compiler is named mpicc.
	cd torc_lite
	./configure CC=mpicc --prefix=$HOME/usr/torc
	make; make install
	export PATH=$HOME/usr/torc/bin:$PATH

   If configure reports missing files, you will need to execute the autoreconf command (autoreconf) before executing ./configure 

   In $HOME/usr/torc/bin there are two files (torc_cflags, torc_libs) that facilitate the development of torc-based programs.
   That's why we have added this directory to the PATH environment variable using the export (bash) command. 
 
   After finishing this step, you must be able to run successfully at least one of the demo examples, available in torc/examples
