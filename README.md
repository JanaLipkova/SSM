# Stochastic Simulation Methods (SSM)
 * Software for stochastic simulations of well-mixed continuous time Markov chain models for chemical reaction networks.
 * The software takes as input .xml file with the list of chemical reactions to be modelled and simulations parameters (initial locaton, final time,...)
 * The supported methods are:
   * SSA (by Gillespie 
   * Tau-leaping (Cao et. al
   * R-leaping   (
   * S-leaping
   * Adaptive Tau- and Adatpive S-leaping

* NOTE
  * the solver contains implementation of methods that currently under revision. We will provide more detailed code discription, installation and test example after the the revision process
  * If you wish to use the solver before, just send mail to (jana.lipkova@tum.de) and we will be happy to provide all the details
