python/anaconda (WARNING):
    Loading this module causes the environment generated by other
    modules to become inconsistent, because Anaconda employs its
    own development environment. This in particular concerns the
    compiler (gcc) and MPI settings, but also other tools, which 
    may cease working correctly.
